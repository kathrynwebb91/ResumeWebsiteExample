Nike have a very particular way of working so it was often a struggle, but always one I revelled in. So much work doesn't make it out so I feel lucky to have so much to show for my time.

                    <div class="job summary">After building up a unique portfolio through Mustard Up, I found it fairly easy to find work in the 'real' industry, but if I'm honest it was just about getting my foot in the door and finding out what made me tick. I quickly got bored of simple digital design updates and 2 week freelance contracts > I craved a more strategic, conceptual opportunity. I was however very lucky to spend some time at Unit 9 working under Anrik Bregman whose advise and work ethic was a direct inspiration.</div>

                    <div class="job summary">Mustard Up started through pure bloodymindedness in the face of endless temping hours and low self morale. I learnt everything on the job, often through my business partner Tom Price, but soon realised that my brain was wired correctly for the creative industries. I dabbled in concept, design, direction, production, management, accountancy and parking fines and that gave me, what I believe to be, a fairly unique, definitely unconventional education in film, digital, print & branding. The fun didn't last forever though > when we got too busy doing corporate animations and couldn't fit in a couple of sets at the tennis court across the road each day Mustard Up was eternally doomed. </div>

                    <div class="description">Every year Hyde park is taken over by the British Summer Time festival for 2 weeks of energizing live music. Their official partner, Barclaycard, had also turned 50 and was in the mood to celebrate. Put these two things together and we had the perfect excuse to create a musical party piece; not just for UK’s most loved credit card, but for every music-lover in Britain.</div>

                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <div class="description">And so The Great British Music Showdown was born. We started by designing a group of 24 digital dancers that represented the UK’s 12 biggest music genres from the past 50 years.</div>

                    <div class="description">We also created a themed background to represent each genre > each featuring a unique, contextual copy template for user personalisation. For the finishing touch, we composed 12 different versions of the same melody for the characters to dance to.</div>

                    <div class="description">Then, to find out which genres we hold closest to our hearts, we partnered with Buzzfeed to design a quiz that would reveal the nation’s musical makeup.</div>
                    <div class="img-container"><img src="images/projectwork/musicshowdown_4.png" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="description">The quiz transformed everyone’s results into their own, personal music DNA…which we used to form a unique dancer, made with parts from our original set. These mix-ups celebrated the UK’s varied taste in the form of personal, sharable animations.</div>

                    <div class="description">On launch day, partygoers at British Summer Time could discover their musical DNA using touchscreens installed at the event and get their dancers immortalised on a piece of essential festival-ware. Online, the mix-ups invaded social networks, encouraged by Buzzfeed. The campaign spread across news sites, bringing in wave after wave of Brits eager to make a one of their own.</div>
                    <div class="img-container"><img src="images/projectwork/musicshowdown_6.png" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="description">Then, we launched a digital version of the Hyde Park festival for all the mix-ups to party at. 1000's of mixed-up dancing genres on a fully navigatable isometric map with filter functionality and an eclectic soundtrack to boot.</div>
                    <div class="img-container"><img src="images/projectwork/musicshowdown_7.png" alt=""></div>
                    <div class="description">The Buzzfeed quiz proved a huge hit, with the average dwell time beating standard Buzzfeed activity 5 times over. More than half a million people completed the quiz, with almost 100,000 sharing their dancer to the virtual festival.</div>

The man curses; ‘Who ever has it, will never be able to keep it’. And so the legend begins. 2 lovers. 1 diamond. A thief. A curse. A classic film noir movie coming straight from late night Paris in the 1960s. And you. You are the spectator, but also the actor. Only you will discover the secrets of The Black Diamond. </div>

For those who missed the event, the site had to be an all in one experience. There was also a functional side to the project, a way to distribute the roughly 1000 free tickets for the live event.</div>
